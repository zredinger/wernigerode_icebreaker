Once upon a time in Berlin Germany, a man drove his "pig" of a car, Porsche, down the Hauptstrasse.
The man suddenly slammed on the breaks as a horde of hungry Hunds dashed across the street and stormed the Ratskeller.
With a start, he realized that he forgot to lock Schloss!
"Dang, this day just doesn't stop," stammered the man as he discretely ensured his Lederhose were dry.
He turned his car around to hurry back to the Schloss but wondered if he should stop at the Baeckerei on the way for some Gebaeck.
Yes, he wanted Baeckerei, but we all know he will get some Apfelkuchen.
Sitting in the biergarten and munching on his apfelkuchen, he began to ponder what it was that he could have possibly been so stressed about.
So he decided to attend Rammstein's concert and let it all out.
After singing along to his favorite song "Du Hast" he went backstage after the concert was over to offer Till Lindemann some brot and bratwurst.
